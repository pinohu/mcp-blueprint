# Automation Workflow Blueprints for Service Businesses

## Overview

This document provides detailed workflow blueprints for automating key business processes in service businesses using the Model Context Protocol (MCP) architecture. Each workflow is designed to be modular, reusable, and adaptable to various service industries while leveraging the context schema and agent framework previously defined.

## Workflow Design Principles

1. **Event-Driven**: Workflows are triggered by specific events rather than scheduled polling
2. **Context-Centric**: All workflow steps read from and write to the persistent context
3. **Agent-Orchestrated**: Each step is executed by a specialized agent with specific responsibilities
4. **Decision-Based Branching**: Workflows include conditional logic based on context data
5. **Error Handling**: Each workflow includes recovery mechanisms for handling exceptions
6. **Auditability**: All workflow executions are logged for tracking and analysis

## Client Lifecycle Workflows

### 1. Client Onboarding Workflow

**Purpose**: Systematically introduce new clients to the business, collect necessary information, and set up their profile for future service delivery.

**Trigger Events**:
- New client registration through website/app
- Manual client creation by staff
- Lead conversion from marketing system

**Workflow Steps**:

```
1. TRIGGER: New client registration event
   |
2. ClientContextAgent: Create basic client profile
   | Context: Write to ClientContext.profiles[client_id].basic_info
   |
3. ClientContextAgent: Send welcome message
   | Context: Read from ClientContext.profiles[client_id].basic_info
   |          Write to ClientContext.interactions[interaction_id]
   |
4. DECISION: Is additional information needed?
   | Context: Read from ClientContext.profiles[client_id]
   |
   |--YES--> 5A. ClientContextAgent: Request additional information
   |         | Context: Write to ClientContext.interactions[interaction_id]
   |         |
   |         6A. ClientContextAgent: Process received information
   |         | Context: Update ClientContext.profiles[client_id]
   |         |
   |         7A. GOTO step 8
   |
   |--NO--> 5B. GOTO step 8
   |
8. ClientContextAgent: Determine client preferences
   | Context: Read from ClientContext.profiles[client_id]
   |          Write to ClientContext.profiles[client_id].preferences
   |
9. SchedulerAgent: Offer initial consultation (if applicable)
   | Context: Read from ClientContext.profiles[client_id].preferences.scheduling
   |          Write to SchedulingContext.appointments[appointment_id]
   |
10. RetentionAgent: Set up engagement plan
    | Context: Read from ClientContext.profiles[client_id]
    |          Write to ClientContext.profiles[client_id].relationship
    |
11. AnalyticsAgent: Update client acquisition metrics
    | Context: Read from ClientContext.profiles[client_id]
    |          Write to AnalyticsContext.metrics[metric_id]
    |
12. COMPLETE: Client onboarding completed
```

**Variations**:

1. **Industry-Specific Information Collection**:
   - Healthcare: Add steps for collecting medical history, insurance information
   - Home Services: Add steps for property details, access instructions
   - Professional Services: Add steps for business requirements, stakeholders

2. **Self-Service vs. Assisted Onboarding**:
   - Self-Service: Client completes all information independently
   - Assisted: Staff member guides client through process
   - Hybrid: Client starts process, staff follows up for completion

3. **Integration-Based Onboarding**:
   - CRM Integration: Pull client data from existing CRM
   - Social Login: Import profile data from social accounts
   - Document Upload: Extract information from uploaded documents

**Error Handling**:
- Incomplete Information: Send reminders with specific missing fields
- Invalid Data: Provide validation feedback and request corrections
- System Failure: Save partial information and allow resuming process

**Performance Metrics**:
- Completion Rate: Percentage of started onboardings completed
- Time to Completion: Average time from start to finish
