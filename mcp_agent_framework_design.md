# MCP Agent Framework for Service Businesses

## Overview

This document provides a detailed design of the Model Context Protocol (MCP) agent framework for service businesses. Each agent is designed to be modular, reusable, and adaptable to various service industries while maintaining specific functional responsibilities within the business automation system.

## Agent Architecture Principles

1. **Context-Driven**: All agents operate primarily through reading from and writing to a persistent context
2. **Single Responsibility**: Each agent focuses on a specific business function
3. **Event-Driven**: Agents respond to triggers and events rather than continuous polling
4. **Stateless Operation**: Agent logic remains stateless while state is maintained in context
5. **Composable Design**: Agents can be combined in different configurations for various business needs

## Agent Interaction Patterns

### Sequential Processing
Agents work in sequence to complete a business process:
```
ClientContextAgent → SchedulerAgent → ServiceDeliveryAgent → FeedbackAgent → BillingAgent
```

### Hub and Spoke
ClientContextAgent acts as a central hub, coordinating with specialized agents:
```
                 ┌─── SchedulerAgent
                 │
                 ├─── ServiceDeliveryAgent
ClientContextAgent ├─── FeedbackAgent
                 │
                 ├─── BillingAgent
                 │
                 └─── RetentionAgent
```

### Feedback Loop
Agents form a continuous improvement cycle:
```
ServiceDeliveryAgent → FeedbackAgent → AnalyticsAgent → ServiceDeliveryAgent
```

### Hierarchical Processing
Agents operate at different levels of business function:
```
                      SystemContext
                           │
                 ┌─────────┴─────────┐
                 │                   │
         AnalyticsAgent       ClientContextAgent
                 │                   │
        ┌────────┴────────┐   ┌─────┴─────┐
        │                 │   │           │
RetentionAgent     BillingAgent   SchedulerAgent   ServiceDeliveryAgent
```

## Agent Communication Protocol

### Event-Based Communication
1. **Event Structure**:
   ```json
   {
     "event_id": "string",
     "event_type": "string",
     "source_agent": "string",
     "timestamp": "datetime",
     "data": "object",
     "priority": "number"
   }
   ```

2. **Event Types**:
   - `context_updated`: Context data has been changed
   - `action_required`: Agent needs to perform an action
   - `information_request`: Agent needs information
   - `status_update`: Agent is reporting status
   - `error_notification`: Agent encountered an error

3. **Event Handling**:
   - Events are published to a central event bus
   - Agents subscribe to relevant event types
   - Events are processed based on priority
   - Event processing is acknowledged

### Context-Based Communication
1. **Context Updates**:
   - Agents write to context with atomic updates
   - Updates include metadata (agent, timestamp, reason)
   - Other agents observe context changes
   - Context history is maintained

2. **Context Locking**:
   - Agents can request exclusive access to context sections
   - Locks are time-limited and can be extended
   - Lock conflicts are resolved based on priority
   - Deadlock prevention mechanisms are in place
