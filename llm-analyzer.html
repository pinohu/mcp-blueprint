You are an expert business process automation consultant. Analyze the following business process in detail and identify 5-7 specific automation opportunities.

Business Process:
${processDescription}

For each automation opportunity:
1. Provide a specific title that clearly identifies the process component being automated
2. Write a comprehensive description (at least 100 words) that:
   - Identifies the exact pain points in the current process
   - References specific elements mentioned in the client's business process
   - Explains precisely what will be automated and how it will work
3. Quantify the business impact with specific metrics:
   - Time savings (hours/week)
   - Cost reduction (percentage or dollar estimates)
   - Error reduction rates
   - Customer satisfaction improvements
   - Employee productivity gains
4. Provide a detailed implementation approach that includes:
   - Specific technologies or tools to use
   - Integration requirements with existing systems
   - Implementation timeline and phases
   - Required resources and expertise
   - Potential challenges and mitigation strategies

Format your response as a JSON array with objects containing title, description, impact, and implementation fields. Make each field extremely detailed and specific to the client's business process.

Currently, your team is manually processing forms, which is time-consuming and error-prone. By implementing intelligent form processing, you can automatically extract data from forms (whether digital or scanned paper forms), validate the information against business rules, and route it to the appropriate systems without human intervention. This will eliminate the manual review step mentioned in your process and ensure data accuracy.`,
                            impact: 'Reduces form processing time by 95% (from hours to minutes), eliminates data entry errors (typically 4-7% in manual processes), saves approximately 15-20 hours per week per employee involved in form processing, and improves customer experience by providing instant confirmation of form submission and faster response times.',
                            implementation: 'Implementation involves: 1) Deploying an OCR and machine learning-based form processing solution like UiPath Document Understanding or ABBYY FlexiCapture, 2) Creating custom data extraction models trained on your specific form types, 3) Building validation rules based on your business logic, 4) Integrating with your existing CRM/ERP systems via APIs, 5) Setting up exception handling workflows for forms that require human review. Timeline: 6-8 weeks for initial implementation with 2-3 weeks of training and optimization.'

This represents a prime opportunity for automation. We can implement an intelligent email automation system that not only sends emails based on triggers but also analyzes responses, categorizes them, and takes appropriate actions. The system will automatically generate personalized emails at each stage of your process, track open and response rates, and intelligently determine when and how to follow up based on customer behavior patterns.`,
                            impact: 'Saves 12-15 hours per week per employee on email management (based on industry averages), increases response rates by 30-40% through optimal timing and personalization, ensures 100% follow-up compliance (eliminating missed communications), reduces customer response time from days to hours, and provides comprehensive analytics on communication effectiveness.',
